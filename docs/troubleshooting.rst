.. _setup_environment:

Set up a clean environment
--------------------------

Many things can cause a broken environment. You might be on an unsupported version of Python.
Another package might be installed that has a name or version conflict.
Often, the best way to guarantee a correct environment is with ``virtualenv``, like:

.. code-block:: shell

    # Install pip if it is not available:
    $ which pip || curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

    # Install virtualenv if it is not available:
    $ which virtualenv || pip install --upgrade virtualenv

    # *If* the above command displays an error, you can try installing as root:
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

    # Create a virtual environment:
    $ virtualenv -p python3 ~/.venv-py3

    # Activate your new virtual environment:
    $ source ~/.venv-py3/bin/activate

    # With virtualenv active, make sure you have the latest packaging tools
    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

    # Now we can install cosine...
    $ pip install --upgrade cosine-crypto

.. NOTE:: Remember that each new terminal session requires you to reactivate your virtualenv, like:
    ``$ source ~/.venv-py3/bin/activate``
