Cosine is a crypto exchange trading algo framework. It provides a modular framework for implementing custom algorithmic
trading strategies, across either single or multiple execution venues, with support for multiple concurrent pricing
feeds from a variety of market pricing sources.

Cosine can support synchronous and asynchronous execution, and is designed with scalability in-mind via a multiprocess
architecture.
